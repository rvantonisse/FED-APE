# FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES
Below you can find a translation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG) created by the World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C-WAI), 
specifically made for front-end development. Instead of the four main principles the WCAG defines, the front-end development accessibility guidelines (FEDAG) counts only three.
These principles are operable, understandable and robust (OUR), leaving the perceivable principle out. This is explicitly done, because:

1.	The perceivable principle is visual content related, which is mostly important to designers and content editors and managers.
2.	Front-end development should make mark-up and additional content related attributes available so that designers and content editors can use them. 
    This is code related of which a part is required to write valid mark-up and code.
3.	Writing standard and valid code is covered with the robust principle.

The translation is made with the help and guidance of the W3C’s document “Understanding WCAG 2.0”. This document is referred to from the WCAG 2.0, 
to explain the guidelines and to help understand how to implement these guidelines. Included technology: HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JS (JavaScript). 
Partly included: ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications).
